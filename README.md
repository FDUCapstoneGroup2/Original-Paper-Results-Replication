## 1. Project Title

**Performance Optimization and Enhanced Encryption in Automatic Data Encryption Systems for Large-Scale Databases**

## 2. Project Description

This project focuses on improving the performance of encryption algorithms used in automatic encryption and decryption systems for sensitive data in large-scale databases. The original system used the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm, which has limitations in both security and performance, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

The goal of this project is to optimize the system by replacing DES with the more secure and efficient AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). This README will guide users through setting up the system, testing its features, and understanding the rationale behind this improvement.

## 3. Original Paper Overview

The system is based on a design from the original paper:
- **Reference**: Zhang, X., Hu, H., & Xu, Y. (2024). The Design and Implementation of an Automatic Encryption and Decryption System for Sensitive Words in Databases Based on Spring Boot. *2024 5th International Seminar on Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Information Technology (AINIT)*, IEEE. DOI: 10.1109/AINIT61980.2024.10581490. [Link to paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10581490)

The paper outlines an automatic encryption and decryption system that leverages JPA’s Attribute Converter to manage sensitive data in databases. However, the system's reliance on DES leads to performance bottlenecks when working with large datasets.

## 4. Problem Statement

DES, while functional for smaller datasets, is outdated and inefficient for modern large-scale applications. Its 56-bit key is susceptible to brute-force attacks, and performance issues arise when scaling to larger datasets. 

**Proposed Improvement**: This project proposes replacing DES with AES, which provides stronger security with key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits and significantly faster encryption speeds.

## 5. Impact of Improvement

The transition to AES will:
- Enhance the system’s **security** by eliminating vulnerabilities in the DES algorithm.
- Improve **performance** when handling large-scale datasets, making the system more suitable for real-world enterprise applications.
  
The performance of DES and AES will be compared using various datasets to quantify these improvements.

## 6. Project Scope

- **Algorithm Optimization**: Replace DES with AES and optimize the system to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Performance Enhancement**: Measure encryption and decryption times for both algorithms and compare their effectiveness.
- **Testing with Large Datasets**: Run tests with large datasets to ensure the system performs well in enterprise-scale environments.

## 7. Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
- **Encryption Libraries**: Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) for AES implementation
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tools**: JUnit for performance testing, SLF4J for logging

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 11+
- Maven 3.x
- A MySQL or PostgreSQL database (or your choice of database) for storing the data
- Postman or any API testing tool

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automaticed.git
cd automaticed
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Database
Create a database named `capstoneDatabase`. Update your `application.properties` file with the correct connection details:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/capstoneDatabase
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### Step 3: Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Encrypt Data (DES/AES)**
Encrypt sensitive data using the AES or DES algorithm.

- **Endpoint**: `/encrypt`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `plaintext` (String): The text to be encrypted.
  - `algorithm` (String): The encryption algorithm (DES or AES).
- **Example**: `/encrypt?plaintext=HelloWorld&algorithm=AES`

### 2. **Decrypt Data (DES/AES)**
Decrypt AES or DES-encrypted data.

- **Endpoint**: `/decrypt`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `ciphertext` (String): The encrypted text to be decrypted.
  - `algorithm` (String): The algorithm used for decryption.
- **Example**: `/decrypt?ciphertext=GeXlTVTmmwZZ2FKFmUCVpQ==&algorithm=AES`

### 3. **Save Orders**
Save multiple orders with randomly generated `user_name` values, which will be encrypted before saving to the database.

- **Endpoint**: `/saveAll`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `count` (Integer): Number of random orders to generate and save.
- **Example**: `/saveAll?count=100`

### 4. **Get Order by ID**
Retrieve the decrypted `user_name` for a specific order.

- **Endpoint**: `/get`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `orderId` (Long): The ID of the order to retrieve.
- **Example**: `/get?orderId=100`

### 5. **Get Paginated Orders**
Retrieve a paginated list of orders.

- **Endpoint**: `/getAllByPage`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `pageNo` (int): The page number to retrieve.
  - `pageSize` (int): The size of the page.
- **Example**: `/getAllByPage?pageNo=0&pageSize=10`

### 6. **Save Orders Manually**
Save a list of orders with their details manually provided.

- **Endpoint**: `/saveByOneself`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**: A list of `OrderEntity` objects in JSON format.
- **Example**: `/saveByOneself`

## How It Works

1. **Encryption and Decryption**: The `CryptoUtil` class is used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information using either the DES or AES algorithm.
2. **Order Management**: Orders are saved and retrieved via the `OrderService`, which interacts with the database. Sensitive information is encrypted before being saved.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: The `saveAll` endpoint logs execution times to monitor performance.
